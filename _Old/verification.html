As noted elsewhere our reliance on numerical linear algebra means our computations cannot be 
certified to be 100% precise, and there is always room for error. In particular, we cannot be sure that 
the Betti numbers we compute are the true Betti numbers and not simply an approximation. Thus, 
whenever possible we work to verify our computations in various ways. Throughout 
the codes Rk-V, Gb-V, MgGb-V, etc. refer to the following verification methods.

<br><br>

<b>Rk-V. Rank Verification.</b> This means we have checked our rank computations using MatLab's 
standard dense rank algorithm rank(A), and the results agree up to machine precision with our
methods. This helps ensure our QR and LU factorization algorithms are working as intended. (Note: Due to the
massive performance decrease experienced when using dense algorithms this verification is only possible on the smallest 
of examples.)

<br><br>

<b>Gb-V. Grobner Verification.</b> This means the Betti table has been
computed using Macuaaly2's symbolic Gr&ouml;bener basis algorthims and it agrees with our results.

<br><br>

<b>MgGb-V. Multi-graded Grobner Verification.</b> This means the multi-graded Betti numbers for this table/entry have been
compute using Macuaaly2's symbolic Gr&ouml;bener basis algorthims and it agrees with our results.

<br><br>

<b>Com-V. Computational Verification.</b> This means our results have been compared to and agrees with one of the results 
via one of the computational results listed below.
<ul>
	<li>
	<b>[CCDL].</b> In their paper [1], Castryck, Cools, Demeyer, and Lemmens, use similar methods to compute
	the Betti table of various Veronese embeddings (n=2, d=2,3,4,5,6, b=0). One of the largest differences between our approaches is
	that they work of large finite fields, and use finite field algorithms to compute ranks. 
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>[GM].</b> In their paper [6], Greco and Martino relate the Betti 
	numbers of Veronese embeddings to the reduced homology certain simplicial complexes. The authors implement 
	ways to compute the reduced homology of these simiplical complexes, allowing them to compute the Betti table
	of various Veronese embeddings (n=2, d=4,5).
	</li>
</ul>

<br><br>
	
<b>Th-V. Theoretical Verification.</b>	This means our result has been compared to and agrees with one of the theoretical results listed below:
<ul>
	<li>
	<b>[Cor. 6.2, Eis05].</b> A basic result in the theory of free resolutions is that the minimal free resolution 
	of the rational normal is an Eagon-Northcott complex. This complete characterizes the Betti numbers of all
	all Veronese embeddings of the projective line. Corollary 6.2 can be generalized to characterize the multigraded Betti 
	numbers and Schur functions for all Veronese embeddings (and their twists) of the projective line.
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>[Lem].</b> In their paper [68], Lemmens provides an explicit formula for the first non-zero
	entry of the nth row of the Betti table of the Veronese embedding of projective n-space.
	</li>
