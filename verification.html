As noted elsewhere our reliance on numerical linear algebra means our computations are never 
100% precise, and there is always room for error. In particular, we cannot be sure that 
the Betti numbers we compute are the true Betti numbers and not simply an approximation. Thus, 
whenever possible we work to verify our computations in various ways. Throughout 
the codes Rk-V, Gb-V, MgGb-V, etc. refer to the following verification methods.

<br><br>

<b>Rk-V. Rank Verification.</b> This means we have checked our rank computations using MatLab's 
standard dense rank algorithm rank(A), and the results agree up to machine precision with our
methods. This helps ensure our qr-factorization algorithm works as intended. We preform this 
verification with the following code (ADD LATER). (Note: Due to the
massive performance decrease when using dense algorithms this verification is only possible on the smallest 
of examples.)

<br><br>

<b>Gb-V. Grobner Verification.</b> This means the Betti table for this particular \(S^{(d)}\) has been
computed precisely using Macuaaly2's Grobener basis algorthims and it agrees with our results. We preform this verfication
via the following Macaualay2 code. 

<br><br>

<b>MgGb-V. Multi-graded Grobner Verification.</b> This means the multi-graded Betti table for this particular \(S^{(d)}\) has been
computed precisely using Macuaaly2's Grobener basis algorthims and it agrees with our results. We preform this verfication
via the following Macaualay2 code. (Note: This verification makes use of the SplendidComplexes package, which is still underdevelopment.)

<br><br>
	
<b>Th-V. Theoretical Verification.</b>	This means our result has been compared to and agrees with one of the theoretical results listed below:
